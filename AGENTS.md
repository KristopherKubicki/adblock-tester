# Repository Agent Guidance

## Web Pages
- Ensure all web pages fit on a single screen without scroll bars.
- Favor responsive layouts that avoid overflow.
- Keep page assets lightweight so the tester loads quickly for everyone.

## Tests
- Maintain high test coverage (baseline 70%+).
- Keep the full suite fast; aim for under 10Â seconds.
