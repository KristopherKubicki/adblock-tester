# Adblock Tester

This repository contains a lightweight adâ€‘block detection tester that can be hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

You can try the live tester at [kristopherkubicki.github.io/adblock-tester](https://kristopherkubicki.github.io/adblock-tester/).

The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/pages.yml` automatically publishes the contents of the repository to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

To enable Pages on your fork:

1. Go to the repository settings on GitHub.
2. Select **Pages** from the sidebar.
3. Choose **GitHub Actions** as the source and save.

After the workflow runs successfully, the tester will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`.

## Customizing Host Categories

The list of hosts that are tested is stored in `categories.json`. Each entry in
the JSON file has a `name` and an array of `hosts` URLs. You can add new
categories or remove hosts by editing this file as long as the JSON structure is
kept intact. The page will fetch `categories.json` at runtime, so any changes
take effect the next time the page is loaded.
