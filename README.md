# Adblock Tester

This repository contains a lightweight adâ€‘block detection tester that can be hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/pages.yml` automatically publishes the contents of the repository to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

To enable Pages on your fork:

1. Go to the repository settings on GitHub.
2. Select **Pages** from the sidebar.
3. Choose **GitHub Actions** as the source and save.

After the workflow runs successfully, the tester will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`.
